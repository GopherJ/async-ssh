# Live-coding

The crate is under development as part of a live-coding stream series intended
for users who are already somewhat familiar with Rust, and who want to see
something larger and more involved be built. For futures-related stuff, I can
also highly recommend @aturon's in-progress [Async in Rust
book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/getting_started/chapter.html).

You can find the recordings of past sessions in [this YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFgY2faCIYjJZv_RluGkTlKt).
This crate started out in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBQwZthJjoM). To get updates about
future streams, follow me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jonhoo) or

# Thank you

For each of the projects I build, I like to thank the people who are willing
and able to take the extra step of supporting me in making these videos on
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jonhoo) or
[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/jonhoo/). You have my most sincere gratitude,
and I'm so excited that you find what I do interesting enough that you're
willing to give a stranger money to do something they love!
