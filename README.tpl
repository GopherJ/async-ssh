# Live-coding

The crate is under development as part of a live-coding stream series intended
for users who are already somewhat familiar with Rust, and who want to see
something larger and more involved be built.

You can find the recordings of past sessions in [this YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFgY2faCIYjJZv_RluGkTlKt).
See also my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jonhoo) and
