# Live-coding

The crate is under development as part of a live-coding stream series intended
for users who are already somewhat familiar with Rust, and who want to see
something larger and more involved be built. For futures-related stuff, I can
also highly recommend @aturon's in-progress [Async in Rust
book](https://aturon.github.io/apr/async-in-rust/chapter.html).

You can find the recordings of past sessions in [this YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFgY2faCIYjJZv_RluGkTlKt).
This crate started out in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBQwZthJjoM). To get updates about
future streams, follow me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jonhoo) or
